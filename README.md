# BLOCKCHAIN-BASED-COMMUNITY-MICRO-INSURANCE
We built a blockchain-based micro-insurance platform at the Aptos Hackathon to serve low-income communities. Powered by Aptos Move and Streamlit, it enables transparent fund pooling, automated claim payouts, and community-driven governance. In 24 hours, we delivered a secure, accessible, and affordable insurance model for underserved populations.
