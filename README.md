**24 Hours. One Global Challenge. One Transformative Solution. 🌍**

At the **Aptos Blockchain Hackathon**, our team — ** Tanmay Kunjir, Mishra Anshika, and Ojas Lanjekar** — set out to address a critical global issue: the lack of accessible insurance for low-income communities surviving on just $2–$5 per day.

Within a single 24-hour development cycle, we successfully built a **blockchain-enabled micro-insurance platform**, powered by **Aptos Move smart contracts** and a user-friendly **Streamlit frontend**. Designed for farmers, gig workers, students, and marginalized populations, the platform offers a reliable, decentralized alternative to traditional insurance systems.

Our solution delivers:

* ✅ **Automated claim processing**
* ✅ **Decentralized governance through community voting**
* ✅ **Transparent and trustless fund pooling**

### 🌍 The Problem

Conventional insurance systems are plagued by:

* ❌ Prohibitive premiums for low-income individuals
* ❌ Lengthy claim resolution times
* ❌ Limited accessibility in rural and informal economies
* ❌ Opaque fund management and lack of user trust

### 💡 Our Solution: Blockchain-Driven Micro-Insurance

By leveraging the inherent transparency and security of blockchain, we reimagined insurance as a community-driven, accessible service:

* ✅ **Shared Fund Pooling**: Members contribute small amounts to a collective pool
* ✅ **Event-Triggered Payouts**: Claims are automatically processed based on predefined criteria (e.g., crop failure, accidents)
* ✅ **Community-Led Verification**: Claims are validated via on-chain voting or oracle-based data
* ✅ **On-Chain Transparency**: All transactions are publicly auditable, eliminating hidden processes

This architecture democratizes insurance, making it viable for populations traditionally excluded by financial or infrastructural barriers.

### 🚀 Technical Overview

* 🔗 **Aptos Move Smart Contracts**: Manage funds, claims, governance, and disbursements securely
* 🗳️ **Decentralized Governance**: Peer voting ensures fraud resistance and inclusivity
* 💻 **Streamlit Interface**: Simple, intuitive UI for wallet creation, claim submission, and status tracking
* 🧪 **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests simulate diverse real-world scenarios

What began as an intense hackathon sprint evolved into a fully functional prototype — a blueprint for inclusive, equitable, and technology-driven insurance. We demonstrated that even under time constraints, innovation powered by blockchain can meaningfully address real-world social challenges.
